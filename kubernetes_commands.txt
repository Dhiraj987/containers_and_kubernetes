minikube cli    → for start up/ deleting the cluster


minikube start --driver=docker  → starts a minikube (virtual box) running on the docker engine
minikube status     → returns the status of the minikube
minikube delete     → deletes the minikube and everything that resides within

                        → creates a deployment with specified name from specified image
